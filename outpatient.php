        <p>The OPD at PCMH serves as the first point of contact for most patients. It provides routine maternal care services including antenatal clinics, postnatal check-ups, family planning, and general consultations. Women are assessed here before being referred for admission or further treatment if necessary. The department helps in early detection of complications during pregnancy and plays a key role in continuity of care for both mothers and newborns after delivery.</p>
