        Ola During Children's Hospital (ODCH) traces its origins to a community-led self-help initiative, later taken over and renovated by the government in 1961, evolving into Sierra Leone's national referral pediatric centerâ€”now equipped with emergency, ICU, neonatal, feeding, and general wards, and significantly strengthened through partnerships like Welbodi, Cap Anamur, and international donors to modernize infrastructure, training, and care systems.
