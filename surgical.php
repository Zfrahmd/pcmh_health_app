        <p>The Surgical Department at PCMH plays a critical role in managing emergency and planned obstetric surgeries. It is mainly responsible for performing Cesarean sections (C-sections), evacuation of retained products, and surgical management of obstetric complications like ruptured uterus or ectopic pregnancy. The department operates in collaboration with the Obstetrics Unit and maintains a sterile environment to minimize post-operative infections. Its skilled surgical team is vital in saving the lives of mothers and babies during complicated deliveries.</p>
